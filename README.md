Overview about Proportional-Rate_Reduction
   (PRR) algorithm as an alternative to the widely deployed Fast
   Recovery and Rate-Halving algorithms.  These algorithms determine the
   amount of data sent by TCP during loss recovery.  PRR minimizes
   excess window adjustments, and the actual window size at the end of
   recovery will be as close as possible to the ssthresh, as determined
   by the congestion control algorithm.
