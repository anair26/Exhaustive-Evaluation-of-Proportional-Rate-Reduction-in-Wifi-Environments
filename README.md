### Overview about Proportional-Rate_Reduction
(PRR) is a new method of fast recovery that recovers from losses quickly, smoothly and accurately by pacing out retransmissions across received ACKs.PRR algorithm is an alternative to the widely deployed Fast Recovery and Rate-Halving algorithms. These algorithms determine the amount of data sent by TCP during loss recovery. PRR minimizes excess window adjustments, and the actual window size at the end of recovery will be as close as possible to the ssthresh, as determined by the congestion control algorithm.
